# LgHS - Website-Vue

## Introduction

The Liege Hackerspace website rebuilt in Vue.

The aim of this project is to offer an alternative to the current website.

The main objective here is to provide an example of what can be done with Vue and to make an initial contribution to the company.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it.
